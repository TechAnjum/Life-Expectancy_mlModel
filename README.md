# Life-Expectancy_mlModel
The Life Expectancy dataset provides a comprehensive look at global health indicators, economic factors, and social conditions across 193 countries from 2000 to 2015. The core objective is to understand the impact of these variables on a countryâ€™s average life expectancy.

This dataset includes demographic, healthcare, disease prevention, and economic development metrics such as:
1)Adult Mortality, HIV/AIDS prevalence, and immunization coverage ,GDP, schooling, and health expenditure
2)Nutritional indicators like BMI and thinness levels

These diverse features make the dataset ideal for building regression models to predict life expectancy and analyze global health disparities between developed and developing nations.

Hence , building a machine learning regression model that predicts life expectancy using health, economic, and demographic indicators.
